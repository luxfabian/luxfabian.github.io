# Noncommutative geometry and noncollinear magnetism

A ferromagnet is a magnetic material which is characterized by the homogenous, collinear polarization of its local order parameter. In contrast, the order parameter of a noncollinear magnet can have a complex structure in real-space. A particular fascinating class of noncollinear magnets inhabits localized topological solitions known as magnetic skyrmions which can be interpreted as nontrivial elements of

\[\pi_2(S_2)\],

the second homotopy group of the sphere. Due to their particle-like, rigid nature, skyrmions have been proposed to serve as future information bit of the future. Understanding the physical properties of skyrmions in real materials is however a difficult task. This is because the their characteristic length scale is often an order of magnitude above the length scale of the crystalline materials which host them.
