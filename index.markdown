Welcome to my homepage! I am a researcher in the field of condensed matter physics. Currently, I am employed as a postdoctoral fellow at Yeshiva University, New York. The primary focus of my work is the application of noncommutative geometry to the physics of hyperbolic and fractal lattices. I am further interested in the implications of noncommutative on the field of noncollinear magnetism.
