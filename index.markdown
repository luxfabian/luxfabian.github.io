Welcome to my homepage! I am Fabian R. Lux, a researcher in the field of condensed matter physics. Currently, I am employed at the Johannes-Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. The primary focus of my current work is the application of noncommutative geometry to the physics of noncollinear magnets.
