Welcome to my homepage! I am Fabian R. Lux, a researcher in the field of condensed matter physics. Currently, I am employed as a postdoctoral fellow at Yeshiva University, New York. The primary focus of my current work is the application of noncommutative geometry to the physics of hyperbolic and fractal lattices as well as noncollinear magnetic systems.
